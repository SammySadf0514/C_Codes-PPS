These are some of the basic C codes which includes playing with numbers and patterns.
I learned most of them during my 1st semester in College because we had a subject called PPS(Programming For Problem Solving) and we usually have to deal with this old C language. We had to do it, for the grades I guess.
I made this repo because I just learned about Git and GitHub and wanted to upload my files on GitHub so I though why don't I publish the C Codes I made and saved during this semester.
I will be adding more codes soon!
